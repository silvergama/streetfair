# Street Fair

![Street Fair](docs/street-fair.jpeg)

The objective of this project is to centralize information about street fairs in the city of SÃ£o Paulo.



## Running

This app is written in Golang. If you don't have experience with it: https://golang.org/doc/install.
It depends on a Golang version with module support (at least 1.11, latest version is recommended).
Should you interoperate with Golang versions >= 1.11, don't forget to proper set your _GO111MODULE_ environment variable (https://dev.to/maelvls/why-is-go111module-everywhere-and-everything-about-go-modules-24k)

### Install deps

- Install `docker` and `docker-compose`

*Attention*: you should first set `$GOBIN` environment variable, add it to the `$PATH`, and then run the commands bellow:


# How to Run

# Docker

This tasks below are used from CircleCI flow but FTW:

Generate `test` image to run tests and coverage:

```sh
make docker/build
```

With the `test` image we can run test and coverage inside CircleCI:

```sh
make docker/test
make docker/coverage
```

Generate final image getting binary from `test` image:

```sh
make docker/image
```
